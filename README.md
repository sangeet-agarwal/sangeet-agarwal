# Hi there, I'm Sangeet ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Azure Solutions Consultant based in Toronto, Ontario.

## About Me

Professionally, I specialize in designing and implementing robust solutions on Microsoft Azure, helping organizations leverage the power of the cloud. I work on a variety of Azure projects, from infrastructure modernization to data platform implementation and cloud-native application development.

This GitHub profile serves a different, but related, purpose. It's my personal space to share projects and code samples that explore different facets of Azure. My goal here is to break down complex cloud concepts into simpler, understandable solutions. Whether you're a student, a developer new to the cloud, or a fellow consultant, I hope you find these repositories helpful for your own learning journey.

I am also going to add some legacy and current on-prem projects that I am working on side by side.
